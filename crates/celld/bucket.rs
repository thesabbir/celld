//! The engine's single object-store client: the `object_store` crate
//! `celld-ltx` already links, bound to one bucket. Replaces aws-sdk-s3.
//! No call site streamed a body, so everything is in-memory `Bytes`.
//!
//! Two conditional-write dialects share the surface. An `s3://` (or
//! bare) spec speaks the S3 dialect: the CAS token is the etag, sent as
//! If-Match / If-None-Match with SigV4 credentials. An `az://` spec
//! speaks the same etag dialect on Azure Blob Storage: Put Blob honors
//! both headers, so only the client and the credentials differ. A
//! `gs://` spec speaks the Cloud Storage XML API dialect: the CAS token
//! is the object generation, sent as x-goog-if-generation-match with
//! OAuth credentials. The distinction is the dialect, not the endpoint —
//! GCS accepts S3-style requests on the same host but does not apply
//! If-Match to a PUT, so only the generation dialect can fence there.
//! Callers never see the difference: the token is an opaque `String` a
//! read answers and a conditional write consumes.
//!
//! Error contract, relied on by the self-fence: `put_cas` answers
//! `Ok(None)` only for a clean 412/409 rejection; every other failure
//! surfaces as `Err`. An `Err` is ambiguous — the write may have
//! committed — unless `cas_write_did_not_commit` recognizes an answer
//! that proves the store wrote no object. In the same spirit a response
//! that carries no CAS token is an error, never an empty token a later
//! conditional write would trust.
