//! Cell storage: SQLite backing for the Durable Object storage API.
//!
//! DO's `ctx.storage` is async in JS but synchronous underneath (local SQLite).
//! We expose synchronous Rust ops to V8 and wrap them in `async` in the JS
//! harness — same contract, no thread-hopping. Each cell is its OWN db file
//! (its own replicated, epoch-fenced bucket prefix), so the JS thread holds a
//! `scope -> Connection` map: `open` on activate, `close` on evict. The
//! `scope` column survives from the single-db era and still keys rows, but a
//! db now holds exactly one cell.
