//! db.rs — SQLite database lifecycle: WAL-mode setup, the long-running read-lock
//! checkpoint takeover, the WAL→LTX capture loop, and manual checkpointing.
//! Ported from litestream@v0.5.11 `db.go`.
//!
//! The highest-risk interaction is a long-running read transaction with a manual
//! `PRAGMA wal_checkpoint`, so the implementation uses independently tested steps.
//!
//! ## Async/blocking shape
//! `rusqlite::Connection` is `!Sync` and a `rusqlite::Transaction` borrows its
//! `Connection`. Rather than thread a borrow across `.await`, this module keeps
//! the capture API **synchronous** and owns the connection directly: the
//! long-running read transaction is held with raw `BEGIN`/`ROLLBACK` SQL plus a
//! `read_lock_held` flag — exactly as Go does (`acquireReadLock` runs `BEGIN` +
//! `SELECT COUNT(1)`, db.go:956-976; `releaseReadLock` rolls back, db.go:979-992).
//! `Replica` drives `sync()` and `checkpoint()` from a blocking context
//! (`spawn_blocking` or a dedicated DB thread). This sidesteps the !Sync/borrow
//! problem entirely and makes the idempotent-release behavior (issue #934) a
//! trivial flag check.
//!
//! ## What this implements (the functional capture path)
//! - `open`/`init`: WAL-mode DSN, `wal_autocheckpoint(0)`, control tables, read
//!   page size, acquire the read lock, ensure the WAL has ≥1 frame.
//! - `acquire_read_lock`/`release_read_lock`: the checkpoint takeover; release is
//!   idempotent (db.go:979-992 / issue #934).
//! - `sync` → `verify` → `sync_inner` → `write_ltx_from_wal`/`write_ltx_from_db`:
//!   diff the real WAL against the last LTX position and write the next L0 LTX
//!   file (`db.go:1517-1723`), with atomic tmp→rename and the pos cache.
//! - `verify`: the snapshot-on-continuity-break branch lattice
//!   (`db.go:1296-1436`), including the issue #900 / #927 edge cases.
//! - `checkpoint`/`exec_checkpoint`: release→`PRAGMA wal_checkpoint(<mode>)`→
//!   re-acquire (`db.go:1875-1919`) and the two-phase WAL-restart handling
//!   (`db.go:1808-1873`).
//! - `checkpoint_if_needed`: the 3-tier policy + the three anti-feedback flags
//!   (`synced_since_checkpoint`/`synced_to_wal_end`/`last_synced_wal_offset`,
//!   issues #896/#927/#997).
//! - Litestream #1292 / celld #150: seal passive checkpoints with a writer
//!   barrier, retain database-growth pages, and snapshot truncate boundaries.
//! - `crc64`, `pos` (cached + `LTXError` mapping), `reset_local_state`,
//!   `snapshot_to_writer`.
//!
//! ## Deferred work outside the functional path
//! - `setPersistWAL` (the `unsafe` `sqlite3_file_control(SQLITE_FCNTL_PERSIST_WAL)`
//!   FFI): only matters when *all* connections close and SQLite
//!   would delete the WAL; the capture path keeps its own connection open.
//! - The background monitor loop, `ensure_exists`, `sync_status`, `sync_and_wait`,
//!   retention, and retry behavior are not implemented.
//! - A `loom` model of the lock protocol.
