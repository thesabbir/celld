//! replica.rs — single-replica sync loop + restore orchestration.
//! Ported from litestream@v0.5.11 `replica.go`.
//!
//! A [`Replica`] connects a managed [`crate::db::Db`] to a replication
//! destination via a [`ReplicaClient`]. It drives two halves of replication:
//!
//! * **sync** (`replica.go:132-180`): copy each new L0 LTX file the capture loop
//!   wrote locally up to the remote replica, advancing the replicated position
//!   one TXID at a time. `calc_pos` (`replica.go:208-214`) recovers the starting
//!   position from the newest file already on the replica.
//! * **restore** (`replica.go:533-725`): download the LTX files from the replica
//!   in TXID order, merge them (the compactor in `ltx.NewCompactor`,
//!   ltx@v0.5.1 compactor.go), and reconstruct the SQLite database file the way
//!   `Decoder.DecodeDatabaseTo` (ltx@v0.5.1 decoder.go:223-268) does — pages
//!   `1..=commit`, lock page zero-filled, written verbatim — to a temp file that
//!   is fsync'd and atomically renamed into place.
//!
//! ## Scope: L0-only, single replica
//! The real `litestream v0.5.11` L0-only architecture stores **everything at
//! level 0** — the snapshot (MinTXID==1) and every incremental — under
//! `ltx/0/`. The snapshot level (`SnapshotLevel = 9`,
//! compaction_level.go:9) is empty without compaction. [`calc_restore_plan`] is
//! ported faithfully (snapshot anchor at `SnapshotLevel` + per-level cursors so
//! adding compaction later "just works"), but in this scope the plan is the
//! contiguous L0 chain `1..=N`.
//!
//! ## Deferred work that needs a background runtime or additional scope
//! * **Follow mode** (`replica.go:730-987`, `applyLTXFile`/`fillFollowGap`): the
//!   continuous tail-restore loop. The current API performs one restore.
//! * **The background monitor goroutine + backoff** (`replica.go:326-441`) and
//!   `Start`/`Stop`: need a Tokio task owning the `Db`; the
//!   synchronous `sync()` primitive it would call is implemented here.
//! * **V3 (v0.3.x generation) restore** (`RestoreV3`, replica.go:990-1096) is not
//!   included because celld has no earlier replica generation to support.
//! * **Timestamp / `-txid` targeted restore plumbing through the public API**:
//!   [`calc_restore_plan`] honors a target TXID, but the
//!   timestamp path and `RestoreOptions` surface stay minimal for the one-shot.

// Restore phase durations are diagnostics in this stand-alone public crate.
// celld injects its scheduling facilities at the engine boundary.
